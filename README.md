# Calculator

https://rob-macfarlane.github.io/Calculator/

This is a small project where I built a calcuator as part of my progression in learning javascript, html, and css. The main takeaways were: 

1. Using logic to determine outputs from user inputs
2. Practice adding event listeners to buttons
3. Manipulation of javascript strings and numbers to perform arithmetic
